Evive Engineering Test

How to run:
When directly calling

python3 source.py

you will see a randomized order along with the output. Note: it may take
several tries to get a valid order.

If you want to run the given test samples, uncomment the test samples from
lines 190-205. You will see the correct output then.

The only dependency in this code is the random module. The random module's
purpose is for the random testing function, which randomly selects a mealtime
and a random amount of numbers ranging from 1 to 3 in order to create a unique
order each time. This way, you can test the function effectively.
